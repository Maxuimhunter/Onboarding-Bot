# Discord Onboarding Bot Excel Integration

## Notes
- The bot collects onboarding data from Discord users and saves it to onboarding_data.xlsx.
- Previously, the bot updated existing user data if the user ID already existed; user now requests that new data should always be appended (not replaced/updated).
- User requests generation of a random but unique code for each new entry.
- The bot should maintain proper formatting and styling in the Excel file.
- The bot and Excel integration have been tested and confirmed working for basic appending and updating.
- Unique code generation and append-only logic are now implemented and tested.
- Next: User requested a !status command to display users and allow activation/deactivation with feedback if already in that state.
