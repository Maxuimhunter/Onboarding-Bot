# Insurance Bot Data Saving Plan

## Notes
- User wants all errors fixed in the onboarding bot.
- Data must be saved to both Excel and the local MySQL database.
- Found an error in save_to_excel: UnboundLocalError for 'os' (likely due to import scope or missing import).
- Database connection and schema appear configured; must verify end-to-end data saving.
- All dependencies have been installed successfully after initial issues with requirements.txt; installed one by one.
- Repeated SyntaxError (expected 'except' or 'finally' block) in save_to_excel, likely due to indentation or misplaced code blocks.

## Task List

- [ ] Identify and fix all errors in save_to_excel
- [ ] Ensure data is saved to Excel correctly
- [ ] Ensure data is saved to MySQL database correctly
- [ ] Test with actual onboarding flow to confirm both saves work
